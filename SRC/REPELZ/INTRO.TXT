 Your region has just been invaded by a neighboring country. You must defend
 your homeland by destroying the invading tanks and surface-to-air (SAM)
 launchers with your drone. They will be advancing on roads leading from the
 region boundary (marked in red). Don't go past the red boundary as the enemy
 has full control of the airways and your drone will be immediately destroyed.
 The SAM installations will launch missiles at your drone when in range. The
 faster you fly the drone, the harder it will be for the SAM to hit, but also
 more difficult to fire at the tanks and SAM launchers.
